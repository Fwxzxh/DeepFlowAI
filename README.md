# DeepFlowAI - Your AI-Powered Focus Guardian

**Tired of telling yourself you'll work on that important report, only to find yourself 2 hours later watching videos of cats playing the piano? Yeah, us too.**

DeepFlowAI is a Chrome extension that acts as your personal focus guardian. It's not just another dumb site blocker. You tell it what you want to accomplish, and it uses the power of Gemini AI to figure out if the website you're trying to visit *actually* helps you achieve that goal. 

If it doesn't, it politely (but firmly) blocks it. Say goodbye to mindless scrolling and hello to deep, uninterrupted work.

---

## What is this sorcery?

It's simple, really. You set an "intention" (a fancy word for your main task), and DeepFlowAI gets to work. When you navigate to a new page, the extension whispers to the Gemini AI:

> *"Hey, my human is trying to 'Write a sci-fi novel'. Is 'youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ' relevant to that? Be honest."*

Based on the AI's judgment, the site is either allowed or blocked. It even tells you *why* it made that decision, so you can't argue with the logic.

## Features

*   **üß† AI-Powered Blocking:** Intelligently blocks sites based on your current task and the page's content (not just the URL).
*   **üìù Justification:** Understand *why* a site was blocked or allowed, right in the extension popup or on the block screen.
*   **üíæ Saved Intentions:** Save long or frequently used intentions and load them with a single click from a dedicated management view.
*   **üçÖ Pomodoro Timer:** A built-in Pomodoro timer that automatically activates Focus Mode during your work sessions.
*   **üòé Two Modes:** Choose between the all-or-nothing **Focus Mode** or the structured **Pomodoro** timer.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Fully Integrated UI:** All settings and views (including Saved Intentions) are handled inside the popup for a seamless experience. No new tabs!
*   **üîß Customizable:** Configure your Gemini API key, choose from the latest models, and even set the word limit for the AI's justifications.
*   **üåó Dark Mode:** Because we care about your eyes during those late-night work sessions.
*   **‚Ü©Ô∏è Smart Back Button:** The block page has a "Go Back to Safety" button that takes you to your last *relevant* page, breaking you out of frustrating back-button loops.
